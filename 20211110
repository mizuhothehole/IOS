Add status ckeck and call only after the status of app became UIApplicationStateActive.

func applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
    if ATTrackingManager.trackingAuthorizationStatus == .notDetermined {
        ATTrackingManager.requestTrackingAuthorization { _ in }
    }
}

Also when multiple pending dialogs showing, not to forget to change the flow, as the may be dialog not shown as expected.
