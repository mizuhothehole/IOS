SwiftUI is a new framework from Apple for 
making user interfaces for Apple devices.
 SwiftUI does not use view controllers so
 when you create a SwiftUI project,
 there arenâ€™t going to be any view 
controllers in the project.

The solution to the issue is to choose 
Storyboard from the User Interface menu
 when you create the project. When you
 tell Xcode to use storyboards for the 
user interface, your project will include
 a view controller and a ViewController.swift 
file.
